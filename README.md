# DINFMM
Code is all written in Julia, so you need to download the language from https://julialang.org/downloads/ before proceeding.

The laplace folder contains the code for running a Laplace problem, while the helmholtz folder contains the code for running a Helmholtz example.

Each folder contains 3 examples: sequential_example512.jl, parallel_example512.jl, parallel_example2048.jl

Using Laplace as an example, to run the code, do:

```
username:> julia sequential_example512.jl
```
